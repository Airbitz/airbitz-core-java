AirbitzCore (ABC) is a client-side blockchain and Edge Security SDK
providing auto-encrypted and auto-backed up accounts and wallets with
zero-knowledge security and privacy. All blockchain/bitcoin private and public
keys are fully encrypted by the users' credentials before being backed up on to
peer to peer servers. ABC allows developers to create new Airbitz wallet
accounts or login to pre-existing accounts. Account encrypted data is
automatically synchronized between all devices and apps using the Airbitz SDK.
This allows a third party application to generate payment requests or send
funds for the users' account that may have been created on the Airbitz Mobile
Bitcoin Wallet or any other Airbitz SDK application.

In addition, the {@link co.airbitz.core.DataStore} object in the Airbitz
{@link co.airbitz.core.Account} object allows developers to store arbitrary
Edge-Secured data on the user's account which is automatically encrypted,
automatically backed up, and automatically synchronized between the user's
authenticated devices.
